         <h2>About QGIC</h2>
         <p>The Queen’s Global Innovation Conference, or QGIC, is proud to be the most interdisciplinary conference at Queen’s. We believe that a culture of innovation and a new approach to problem solving are necessary as we challenge the increasingly complex global problems of today. We will explore the large issues such as health care, food production, and poverty, with a focus on the role of technology within these systems. QGIC is designed to teach, inspire, and serve as a catalyst for delegate innovations. We are founded on the belief that great ideas are not born from epiphany but rather from an ever colliding network of thoughts, questions, and perspectives. It is from these collisions that innovations are born. A participant driven conference, delegates will leave with the tools to innovate, lead, and inspire in order to join the movements that are changing the world.</p>
         <h3> Innovation Challenge</h3>
	<p> Delegates will participate in speaker presentations and workshops, and then apply their skills within a team in the Innovation Challenge. Interdisciplinary teams will be required to design a solution to a problem facing the Kingston area. A panel of judges will decide which group receives $1000 to put their plan into action. Funding for the challenge is provided by Queen’s Innovation Connector. The winning team is also eligible to present to the City of Kingston climate change panel.</p>
         <h3>Our Vision &mdash; The Power to Change systems</h3>
         <p>We believe that addressing complex global issues will require a different approach than the one we’ve been using.</p>
         <h3>Here’s what we’re doing differently:</h3>
         <div class="doing collabs">
            <h4 class="big">Collaborative Innovation</h4>
            <blockquote>
               For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong
               <cite>H. L. Mencken</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>No one person holds the solution. Solutions will come from the experiences, insights and creativity of a group of individuals working together toward a common goal. Solutions will require coordination across industries, disciplines, and silos.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="doing systems">
            <h4 class="big">Systems Thinking</h4>
            <blockquote>
               We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.
               <cite>Donella H. Meadows</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The challenges we face are increasingly complex and interconnected. Complexity is the nature of living systems and the world we live in. Systems thinking teaches us to work within a system’s constraints to achieve desired results and avoid unintended consequences. It stresses the role of interconnections, including the role we play within the system.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="doing leaders">
            <h4 class="big">Leadership</h4>
            <blockquote>
               Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.
               <cite>Margaret Mead</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Delegates should leave the conference feeling empowered to take action, and equipped with the necessary tools to accomplish their goals. We want to challenge delegates to ask questions about themselves and the systems they operate within, and to be leaders in their communities.</p>
